<h2>What is CodeSheet</h2>
<p>CodeSheet is the fusion of a few simple ideas to hopefully make a simple yet useful web application.</p>
<p>I draw inspiration for CodeSheet from <b>Scala WorkSheet</b>, an Eclipse plugin maintained by Typesafe that makes testing out simple expressions and problems simple and fun mainly by printing out the result of each line of code right next to that line. This saves many printlns and makes it easier to understand what is going on in the snippet at a glance.</p>
<p>Secondly, ScalaKata.com (as well as repl.it) is a simple web application that demonstrated to me the convenience of a web based approach with minimal configuration even without all the bells and whistles of a full fleged IDE.</p>
<p>Lastly, I must credit LightTable with the spark that made me figure out that for the use case I was targeting, there was no point in having the user manually trigger compilation and execution, why not just do that continually and present the results immediately. Furthermore, I realised it made for a much more pleasant experience if the tool tries itâ€™s best to evaluate the result of all valid expressions on the sheet even if some other expression is not currently valid.</p>
<p>All of this mixed in with realtime collaboration and I hope I have made a tool that will turn out to be useful. At the same time, CodeSheet remains very experimental, I hope to get a better sense of the usefulness of realtime collaboration.</p>
<p>With Google Drive integration, I hope the persisting and sharing capabilities of the application will make it all the more useful.</p>
<p>If all goes well, I hope to add the additional features such as code completion and code modularization to the application in the future.</p>
