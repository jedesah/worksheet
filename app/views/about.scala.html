    <h2>What is CodeSheet</h2>
    <p>CodeSheet is the fusion of a few simple ideas to hopefully make a simple yet useful web application.</p>
    <p>I draw inspiration for CodeSheet from <b>Scala WorkSheet</b>, an Eclipse plugin maintained by Typesafe that makes testing out simple expressions and problems simple and fun mainly by printing out the result of each line of code right next to that line. This saves many printlns and makes it easier to understand what is going on in the snippet at a glance.</p>
    <p>Secondly, <b>ScalaKata.com</b> (as well as <b>repl.it</b>) is a simple web application that demonstrated to me the convenience of a web based approach with minimal configuration even without all the bells and whistles of a full fleged IDE.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I must credit <b>LightTable</b> with the spark that made me figure out that for the use case I was targeting, there was no point in having the user manually trigger compilation and execution. Why not just do that continually and present the results immediately? Furthermore, I realised it made for a much more pleasant experience if the tool tries its best to evaluate the result of all valid expressions on the sheet even if some of them are not currently valid. This feature is also a very partial solution to the problem I will outline later in the section about RealtimeCollaboration relative to harmonizing concurrent changes to the same code base. Indeed, to a limited extent, CodeSheet supports two developers working on separate lines. Even if one line fails to be compiled, the second can still be evaluated and the result printed out as long as it is a valid expression, either standalone or depending on other previous expressions that are also valid.</p>
    <p>All of this mixed in with realtime collaboration and I hope I have made a tool that will turn out to be useful. At the same time, CodeSheet remains very experimental, I hope to get a better sense of the usefulness of realtime collaboration.</p>
    <p>With Google Drive integration, I hope the persisting and sharing capabilities of the application will make it all the more useful.</p>
    <p>If all goes well, I hope to add the additional features such as code completion and code modularization to the application in the future.</p>
    <h2>Realtime Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Collaboration has always been an important part of development. A team has a very wide range of skills with which to tackle a problem. Furthermore, working with a team is motivating and rewarding. With the evolution of computer science and the increasing complexity of problems that software developers face, larger teams are needed and collaboration is getting more and more important. In this essay, I will define realtime collaboration, specifically as it relates to programming, and explore what this means for the future of collaboration.</p>
    <p>I will define realtime collaboration as a capability for a tool to allow two or more people to work in the same space at the same time. In such a way, the tool I am using right now to write this essay, Google Docs, allows realtime collaboration.</p>
    <p>Realtime collaboration has many benefits: it can contribute to making sure everyone is on the same page as well as help avoid some of the costs associated with merging work done in parallel. However, it is not always best to be working in the same space; we ideally want our tools to retain the possibility of working “offline”.</p>
    <p>Realtime collaborative applications are beginning to surface. Google has a suite of realtime collaborative applications that are integrated in its Drive service. Furthermore, some third party applications that integrate with Google Drive are offering certain realtime capabilities. LucidChart is a good example of such an application. There are also other applications that have nothing to do with the Drive service that also offer forms of realtime collaboration.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned above, many different kinds of realtime collaborative applications are surfacing. This makes sense since I see no obvious reasons why most types of tasks performed on a computer could not benefit from realtime collaboration.</p>
    <p>Of particular interest to me are IDEs. Very few IDEs are currently supporting realtime collaboration. This is probably due to the increased complexity of providing a seamless experience when it comes to the activity of producing code.</p>
    <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
    <p>Pair programming is a very effective technique when applied correctly and in the right circumstances. I have done a fair bit of pair programming in academic and personal projects and I have learned to appreciate its strength. However, my observations lead me to believe that pair programming is not a widely practiced technique. This is possibly due to a lack of appropriate tools for the job.</p>
    <p>When starting out at pair programming, I used the most primitive of approaches: my co-worker and I simply sat down next to each other with a single mouse, keyboard and screen. One person usually had total control of the input devices. This methodology actually works surprisingly well except that you eventually get tired of tilting your head in an awkward way to see what is going on on the screen. It’s also not a very scalable approach, although I have rarely felt the need to triple program for extensive amounts of time.</p>
    <p>Next came screen share. Of course, it’s best ideally to still be in person, but of course it makes long distance pair programming possible. Lastly, I have been using remote desktop. This is slightly better than a simple screen share because both programmers involved can easily access the input devices.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I found that during some periods of time, particularly when trying to figure out why something is behaving unexpectedly, it becomes very frustrating not to be able to look at two different parts of the code at the same time.</p>
    <p>In regard to developing collaborative tools, I believe that solving the problem of pair programming is actually considerably easier than solving the general problem of realtime collaboration. When two people are pair programming, they are working on the exact same issue. This makes implementing the tool easier than with full realtime collaboration because there is no need to worry about how to harmonize concurrent changes. In other words, simply allowing the programmers to independently navigate the same version of the code would go a long way towards making pair programming more accessible. Implementing the tool for complete realtime collaboration probably involves designing new programming languages that make it easier for two developers to work on seperate parts of the code without blocking the other one.</p>
    <h3>Offline Collaboration</h3>
    <p>The dominant way to collaborate on code today is by using version control systems such as CVS, SVN or Git. These tools have gotten progressively better over the years. For instance, the forking and branching models of modern version control systems such as Git, Mercurial or Bazzar have much improved since their predecessors. However, one thing that is still missing in these version control systems is realtime collaboration. These tools are extremely good at tracking offline changes; however, they offer no way for developers to collaborate on their projects in realtime.</p>
    <h3>Further decoupling collaboration and versioning</h3>
    <p>One thing that distributed version control systems do better than their traditional counterparts is decoupling sharing and versioning. Indeed, it is impossible to version a change with a tool like SVN without simultaneously sharing it with all of your team. Combined with the awkwardness of branching, these tools are significantly less powerful, from the simple use case of taking snapshots while not connected to the Internet to the more complex use case of prototyping a large feature without burdening your fellow teammates with the unstable changes.</p>
    <p>In opposition, a tool like Git allows the user to take snapshots while not connected to the Internet and gives him full prototyping flexibility. Indeed, these tools allow the user to take a snapshot of a change (commit) without sharing (push, pull) with others.</p>
    <p>This is a very powerful improvement but we could do even better. We can currently version without sharing; however it is not possible to share without versioning and that is what realtime collaboration brings to the table.</p>
    <h3>Workspace</h3>
    <p>I previously defined realtime collaboration as the possibility for two or more people to work in the same space at the same time. Let’s defined a workspace as a space that one or more people can use to work on the exact same version of the code, with changes in realtime and accessibility from any device. Ideally, workspaces should support versioning, forking and merging.</p>
    <p>Current version control systems offer a limited concept of workspace. They all lack the possibility for two people to work in the same one at the same time and most lack the possibility to access a workspace from any device.</p>
    <p>I look forward to the day where a workspace becomes a separate notion than that of a workstation, one in which a team can choose to have 9 developers work in 9 different workspaces, or have 8 developers work in 4 different workspaces with the 9th jumping in to different workspaces to help out.</p>
